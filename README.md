# LeetCode Algorithm Solutions

My personal collection of **75+ LeetCode algorithm solutions** as I grind through leetcode problems!

## What's This?

I'm solving LeetCode problems and storing all my solutions here. Each folder has the problem, my code, some notes, and test cases. It's basically my practice journal but in code form.

## How It's Organized

Each problem folder contains:

- The problem description with examples
- My solution (mostly in JavaScript)
- Quick explanation of how I solved it
- A few test cases to verify it works

## Running The Solutions

Just open any `.js` file and run it:

```bash
node filename.js
```

You'll see the test results right away.

## Progress

Working on **75+ problems** 

## Topics I'm Tackling

- Arrays & Strings
- Linked Lists
- Trees & Graphs
- Dynamic Programming
- Sorting & Searching
- Hash Tables
- Stack & Queue
- More coming!
